# Trello-Jira Sync

A scalable bidirectional synchronization solution between multiple Trello boards and Jira projects, designed to run via GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Multiple Boards**: Synchronize various Trello boards with different Jira projects simultaneously
- **Flexible Configuration**: Define which fields to sync for each connection
- **Customizable Intervals**: Configure different synchronization intervals per connection
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes on both platforms are propagated
- **Advanced Mappings**:
  - Trello checklists → Jira subtasks
  - User mentions converted between platforms
  - Attachments (links)
  - Due dates and labels

## Quick Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emernuness/trello-jira-sync.git
   cd trello-jira-sync
   ```

2. Copy the environment variables template:
   ```bash
   cp config/.env.template .env
   ```

3. Configure your connections in `config/mappings.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   connections:
     - trello:
         board_id: "your-board-id-1"
         api_key: "TRELLO_KEY_1"
         token: "TRELLO_TOKEN_1"
       jira:
         project_key: "PROJ_1"
         host: "https://your-company.atlassian.net"
         user: "JIRA_USER_1"
         api_token: "JIRA_TOKEN_1"
       sync:
         interval: "*/5 * * * *"
         fields:
           - title
           - description
           - checklists
   ```

4. Set credentials in `.env` or as GitHub secrets.

For detailed configuration of multiple board-project pairs, environment variables, and examples, see the [Detailed Configuration Guide](docs/DETAILED_CONFIG.md).

## Execution
